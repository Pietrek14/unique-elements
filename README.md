# unique-elements

For my IT lessons I got an assignment to implement an algorithm searching two sorted arrays for unique elements.

### Example

Array 1: **1 3 3 5 6**

Array 2: **1 2 3 4**

Result: **2 3 4 5 6**

## Make

- `make / make build` - builds the program
- `make run` - runs the program

## Input

Program reads input from _dane.txt_ file (in the _build_ directory). The first two numbers are the lengths of arrays 1 and 2. In the two next lines there are the elements of array 1 and 2.

## Output

The program outputs just the result to console.
